# Ethical AI Application – Proposal & Prototype

This repository contains our group project for the development of an AI application that addresses a significant ethical issue caused by AI, following Agile software development practices and guided by the Ethical Reasoning Framework (ERF).

## 📌 Project Overview

Our goal is to design and prototype an ethical AI solution that responds to a real-world ethical issue in current AI technologies. The project is divided into two parts:

- Proposal Report
- [Functional Prototype](https://www.figma.com/design/ddvKhqUKOA0blT7MjYFZkQ/Solution-to-AI-problem-Prototype?node-id=24-1242&p=f) <- Prototype link

## 🧠 Problem Statement

We analyze a technical-ethical issue arising from an existing AI application and propose an AI solution that aims to resolve or mitigate this issue. Our approach is informed by:

- Ethical Reasoning Framework (ERF)
- ACM Code of Ethics
- Agile team practices

---

## 🚀 Proposed AI Solution

Our solution is structured using the Ethical Reasoning Framework (ERF):

### ERF Steps:
1. **Categorize Problem Statement**: Refer to the ACM Code of Ethics.
2. **Create User Stories**: Define who the users are and their ethical concerns.
3. **Identify Product Features**: List functionalities of the AI solution.
4. **Apply Ethical Theory**: Use ethical systems (e.g., utility, virtue ethics, deontology) to guide product design.
5. **Design Product UI & Behavior**: Use Figma (design tool) to develop the conceptual visualization of the final product.
6. **Create Pseudocode**: The code which would determine the underlying logic used to function the product.

## 🧰 Agile Team Process

We use Agile principles to ensure structured and collaborative development:

- **Sprint Planning & Meetings**: Weekly/biweekly sprints with regular stand-ups and retrospectives.
- **Team Roles**: Product Owner, Scrum Master, Developer(s), Research Lead, etc.
- **Collaboration Tools**: Google Docs, Trello/Notion, GitHub Issues & Projects
- **Leadership Approach**: Shared leadership through Agile values (collaboration, transparency, adaptability)

## 🧾 Deliverables

- `Proposal_Report.pdf`: Full report covering background, ethical analysis, proposed solution, and Agile process.
- `Prototype/`: *(To be added)* Initial functional prototype of the proposed AI application.

---

## 🤝 Team & Contributions

We follow clear task delegation through Agile ceremonies. Roles and responsibilities are transparently agreed upon and rotated as needed for effective learning and output.
